## Agenda Items
| Number   |                   Item |
|:---------|-----------------------:|
| 1        |  Finalize idea for app |
| 2        |      This week's goals |
| 3        |           Assign tasks |

## Meeting Minutes
I. Finalize idea for app

We will make an Outdoor activities Community app with main features: facts, comments, basic, profile, training source

II. This week main tasks:

- UML for parts that youâ€™re interest (Figma)

- Research about related features

Notes from meeting: We agreed that the best thing for each of us to do right now is whatever we are confident in doing. So if there is a particular part of the app that you are interested in or feel compelled to have a go at, just do it and share your progress on Figma. Later we can combine our thinking and divide things up more precisely. It's difficult to assign tasks and divide things right now because there is not much to divide :)
