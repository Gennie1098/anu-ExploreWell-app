Qihua suggests an idea for the app as follows:

[15:19] Qihua Huang
We can develop a gamfied environmental protection app.  
It canencourage people to walk, savefood and know more about animals
lt may have serval parts.  
First, users can gain a card by using the app everyday. The card has an animaprofile and words to introduce theanimals( UNESCO 14 and 15)
Second, users can upload photosbefore and after the disc. show thatthey have disc action. Then they candraw a rare card. (UNESCO 13)
Third, they can upload their stepseveryday. After the daily andmonthly goals are achieved, theycan also draw a rare card.(UNESCO3 and 13)
we can also make a leaderboard tomotivate them to participate

We're discussing how we can meet the specifications of the application.

Gennie also presented an idea about tracking the user's carbon footprint.

We decided to write up a proposal for each idea so that we can later agree on one and fully address the specification.

Gennie created a Figma board that we can collaborate on to brainstorm our ideas for the app over the next week.
